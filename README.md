# Javascript Projects
This repository holds a bunch of projects that were created during the process of following along tutorials.
This repository is start to help me refresh my js skills and build on them in the process. I found a bunch of
tutorials for projects done in vanilla js. My intent is to follow along with these tutorials and after each
tutorial, I will add things that I learned to each project. After adding to each project, I will then re-create
the project using react.js, so that I can grasp the basics of that library and prepare myself for more advanced
techniques to be learned in react. Another purpose of this repository is to serve as a collection of useful js
projects that could be referenced.
